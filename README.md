# :trophy: &nbsp; Goal: Collect, categorize and disseminate Crypto

## This repo

 The purpose of this repo is to lay the foundational components needed for a network pursuing one end\(Crypto\).
 This repo is the first step of many towards the ultimate goal of creating a new Crypto resource.
 This goal will loosly require three major steps: The Industriuos gitbook, the Industry Index and the Indstry dApplication.
 Each of these steps build upon the last.

 ### :hammer: Step One

# :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Industrious book

## A unspoken account of Crypto and human Industry

Crypto has succeded in large part becuase of utility and being able to meet Mankinds needs when conducting *business*. Crypto has been iteratively devloped for over 1200 years through many modifications in the way man would systematically obscure sensitive information. Until very recently Crypto means were only used for country and state level needs due to the complexity and security those applications required.

## ToDo - :heavy_check_mark:

- [ ] Crypto history from conception to Bitcoin
- [ ] The story of crypto and its link to *the* Industry.
